This is the best part of the whole process to find out why linen fabric is so great and is widely used:

* Non-Allergenic. Organic linen does not cause allergies and is perfect for sensitive skin
* _Air permeability_. (Breathability) Highly breathable linen sheets design let your skin breathe through the night
* _Massage effect._ Due to its structure, linen fabric increases blood circulation and relieves fatigue during sleep
* _Thermal conductivity_.  Linen is capable of reducing the heat not only in the wet but also in a dry environment to prevent overheating. On warmer evenings linen will keep the air around your body several degrees cooler; on colder nights -- it keeps you warm like a wool blanket
* _Hygroscopicity_. (Moisture wicking properties )Linen absorbs moisture (up to a quarter of its own weight), and dries quickly
* _Hygiene_. Linen fiber prevents inflammatory processes and fungal diseases. In medicine flax was used to cover and heal wounds
* _Anti-static_. Linen fibers do not produce charges of static electricity. Therefore, bedding sheets stay clean for longer
* _Durability_. The high durability of linen fibers allows the material to easily withstand a large number of washings, without losing its properties (30% stronger than a cotton)
