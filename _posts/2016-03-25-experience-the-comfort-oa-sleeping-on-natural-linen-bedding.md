# Experience the comfort oа sleeping on natural Linen bedding

Our linen bedsheets are made only from 100% pure linen, which natural qualities will lullaby you into an anti-stress sleep, massaging and letting your body breath throughout the night. On warmer evenings linen will keep the air around your body several degrees cooler; on colder nights -- it keeps you warm like a wool blanket. Linen is often called 'nature's wicking fiber', scientifically speaking it has high hygroscopicity, meaning that fibers are able to absorb a lot of moisture before they will first begin to feel damp. Your sleep will be free of cold sweats and wake up energized. Overall linen interacts well with our bodies and contribute to our comfort, allowing you to sleep longer.
