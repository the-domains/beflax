Linen is a textile weaved out of fibers of the Flax plant. Overnight linen became very popular because of its strength and versatility. Flax production began a century ago, and was developed from the ancestors' traditions. Any household could have been engaged in the production of linen fabric not only for personal use, but also for sale.  Even with the arrival of mechanized workshops in the 18th century, flax production still done by hand due to the specificity of linen yarn production. Therefore linen fabric has always been considered a top material.

The thread for the linen yard comes directly from the stem of a flax plant. It is necessary to comply with all the details of the extraction process according to traditions. Many housewives used some primitive tools made of wood to knead the stems before a laborious process of studding to slide the entire length of the stems.

### PRODUCTION TODAY 

Today linen yarn and fabric production is much more simplified thanks to a specially designed machines as well as new technology used to extract fibers through a spinning process. First the harvested flax is being soaked for a week, occasionally moved to in a new water containers then dried. When the stalks are dried they are bound into a round ball for the ease of movement. The ball is then beaten in a special tumbler, where the linen stalks are separated from the stems and other peels through spinning rollers. Each of the flax stalks is straightened and extracted from the ball. The next stage involves stalks carding to form a suitable fiber state to then fall on a spinning machine that makes the actual thread for the linen yarn. Yarn is then weaved into the actual fabric that we call linen.
